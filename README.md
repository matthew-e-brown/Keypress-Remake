# Keypress Game, Remade
Recreating my Grade 11 culminating project with more Pythonic code and some OOP.

The original project, which I lovingly named ["Keypress Game,"](https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/Grade-11-Python-CCA) was written between the dates of April 10<sup>th</sup> to June 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017. It was inspired by [Nerd<sup>3</sup>'s game, Systems Nominal](https://www.nerdcubed.co.uk/games/), which it is very similar to. 

## How to Play
There are instructions that pop up in-game, but here is a rundown.

This game could be thought of as one of those 'so-and-so teaches typing' games. I originally came up with the idea after seeing how poorly my classmates knew the layout of their keyboard. 

In the game screen, there is an unlabelled keyboard made up of green keys. At random, one key will turn red. The goal is to press the key as fast as possible. As soon as a key is pressed, another key becomes red. The more keys you can press successfully before time runs out, the higher your score. You can make five mistakes before failing.
